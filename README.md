## Description
The Twitter Clone App mimics the functionality of the popular Twitter website. Twitter is a social networking site that allows people to post their thoughts with a large audience. 

In this app, users can share messages (tweets) with friends by posting a tweet from the home page. The tweet is then displayed on the home page for all users to see. Each posted tweet has a navagation bar below the tweet content, which can be used to reply to, retweet, like, or bookmark the message. The amount of replies and likes for a specific tweet are recorded in the nav bar next to their respective icons. Replying to a message will take users to a thread page, which will display all the replies for that tweet. When a user retweets a message, that message is redisplayed at the top of the home screen, with an indicator showing which user rewteeted the message.

The navigation bar on the left side of the app can be used to navigate to the user's profile page, which will show all of the user's tweets and likes. The bookmark page can also be visited from the nav bar, which will show all tweets saved as a bookmark.
