## Description
The Space Jam word game is a themed take on the classic game of hangman, in which a player is given an unknown word and has to correctly guess the word by choosing letters. If the letter is contained in the unknown word, then the letter is revealed and the player continues. If the letter is not in the word, the player "loses a life," which is represented by one part of a picture being drawn. If the picture is complete (the player has used all available guesses), then the player has lost the game.

In this version of the game, a player is given a secret word displayed on the screen. The player has 6 guesses to reveal the secret word before the Monstar appears. The player is able to choose the category of the secret word by clicking the "categories" button. The player has 3 hints that can be used, which will display a letter in the secret word that has not already been correctly guessed. If the word is guessed correctly, the player wins. The game can be reset at any time by pressing the "reset" button.
