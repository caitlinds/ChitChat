# ChitChat

## Description
ChitChat mimics the functionality of the popular Twitter website, which is a social networking site that allows people to post their thoughts with a large audience. 

In this app, users can share messages with friends by posting a message from the home page. The message is then displayed on the home page for all users to see. Each posted message has a navigation bar below the message content, which can be used to reply to, repost, like, or bookmark the message. The amount of replies and likes for a specific message are recorded in the navigation bar next to their respective icons. Replying to a message will take users to a thread page, which will display all the replies for that post. When a user reposts a message, that message is redisplayed at the top of the home screen, with an indicator showing which user reposted the message.

The navigation bar on the left side of the app can be used to navigate to the user's profile page, which will show all of the user's posts and likes. The bookmark page can also be visited from the navigation bar, which will show all messages saved as a bookmark.
